# Introduction

This is a very simple native PHP template engine based on the ideas as found in 
[Plates](http://platesphp.com/). The templates are mostly compatible with 
Plates templates, so it is easy to switch.

The following features are (not) yet part of Plates, but hopefully are some 
time in the future:

- Themes, this is not working 
  [properly](https://github.com/thephpleague/plates/issues/234) in Plates;
- Internationalization (multi language support)

If you need neither of these features, I recommend you to use Plates.

# Example

You can define a "layout", say in `base.php`, and various templates that 
"inherit" this template.

For example, `base.php` contains this:

    <html>
      <head>
        <title><?=$this->e('title')?></title>
      </head>
      <body>
      <div class="content">
          <?=$this->section('content')?>
      </div>
      </body>
    </html>

Then, for example the template `page.php` contains this:

    <?php $this->layout('base.php', ['title' => 'Page'])?>
    <?php $this->start('content') ?>
        <p>
            This is the content that will be placed in the "base.php" template 
            in the "content" section.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <?php foreach($simpleList as $listEntry): ?>
                <li><?=$this->e($listEntry)?></li>
            <?php endforeach ?>
        </ul>
    <?php $this->stop() ?>

You'd render the template like this:

    <?php

    $tpl = new Template(
        [
            '/path/to/templates'
        ]
    );
    echo $tpl->render('page', ['simpleList' => ['a', 'b', 'c']);

# Themes

The path to the constructor is an array which can contain multiple folders. 
The first folder points to the "base" template. Additional folders can 
override specific templates (or all of them).

    <?php

    $tpl = new Template(
        [
            '/path/to/templates',
            '/path/to/my_theme',
        ]
    );

The library will first check the `my_theme` folder for templates, if they are 
missing there, the search will continue in the preceding folder(s).

# Internationalization

    <?php

    $tpl = new Template(['/path/to/templates'], '/path/to/locale/nl_NL.php');
    $tpl->render('foo', ['foo' => 'bar']);

In the template you use this:

    <?=$this->t('Hello %foo%!')?>

The translation file, i.e. `nl_NL.php` in this example contains this:

    <?php

    return [
        'Hello %foo%!' => 'Hallo %foo%!'
    ];
