# Introduction

This is a very simple native PHP template engine based on the ideas as found in 
[Plates](http://platesphp.com/). The templates are mostly compatible with 
Plates templates, so it is easy to switch.

The following features are (not) yet part of Plates, but hopefully are some 
time in the future:

- Theming, this is not working 
  [properly](https://github.com/thephpleague/plates/issues/234) in Plates;
- Multi Language Support (translatable strings)

If you need neither of these features, I recommend you to use Plates.
